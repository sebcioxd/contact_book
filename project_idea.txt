We come across lots of people daily. We make acquaintances and friends. We get their contacts to keep in touch later on. Sadly, keeping the received contact details can be hard. One way to do this is to write the contact details down. But this is not secure as the physical book can easily be lost.

This is where the Contact Book project comes in. A contact book is a tool for saving a contact’s details, such as name, address, phone number, and email address. With this contact book project, you can build a software tool that people can use to save and find contact details.

With the contact book project idea, users can save their contacts with less risk of losing the saved contact details. It’ll always be accessible from their computer, through the command-line.

project schema:
1. Make the basic CLI.
2. Make class named contact (email, phone number, name)
3. Take from the user the input and store the object, then put the object into array.
4. We can manipulate the contacts, by adding them, removing them & writing them to a file.
